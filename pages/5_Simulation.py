        ### Summary of Experimental Approach
        
        This experimental design aims to test hypotheses derived from computational simulation of bacterial
        phenotype regulation. The proposed methods will characterize the genetic and metabolic basis
        of the biofilm-motility transition, identify key regulatory components, and validate computational
        predictions.
        
        The results will provide:
        1. Validation of key regulatory genes identified in simulations
        2. Characterization of metabolic trade-offs between phenotypes
        3. Understanding of adaptation mechanisms in varying environments
        4. Insights into potential targets for controlling bacterial behavior
